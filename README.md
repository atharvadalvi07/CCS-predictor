**Concrete Strength Predictor**


*Overview*
The Concrete Strength Predictor is a computational tool developed to estimate the compressive strength of concrete mixtures based on their composition. It aims to provide engineers and construction professionals with a convenient method to predict concrete strength, thereby reducing the need for time-consuming and costly physical testing.

*Features*
Data Model Building: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze a dataset of concrete mixtures and build predictive models for compressive strength.
Interface for Strength Prediction: Allows users to input the composition of a concrete mixture and obtain an estimated compressive strength, along with an assessment of uncertainty in the prediction.
Database Management: Enables users to add new observations to the underlying database and automatically updates the data model to incorporate the new data.
Multiple Model Options: Provides multiple model options including multiple linear regression, exponential data model, and power-law model, allowing users to choose the most suitable model based on their requirements.

*Installation*
Clone the repository from GitHub.
Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt.
